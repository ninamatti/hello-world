HELLO WORLD!

This is my first repository created while going over the hello-world guide.

As a budding software engineer, I aim to acquire an ever-growing skillset that will enable me to create smart support programs and games that motivate people in their everyday lives, give them a little bit of joy each time they use them, and help them deal with their worldy struggles more efficiently.

For now, I am very excited to learn more about GitHub and how to interact with it!
